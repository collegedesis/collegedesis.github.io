        <p>Dear everyone,</p>
        <p>
          I started <span class='title'>College</span><span class='title brown'>Desis</span> 3 years ago
          with a Twitter account and it quickly became a nationally recognized brand.
          My goal was to open up channels of communication among the hundreds of South Asian student
          organizations in America and to encourage them to collaborate on projects
          larger than themselves.
        </p>
        <p>Although we did some remarkable things, I have decided to move on to other things.</p>
        <p>
          If you worked with CollegeDesis in the last three years, you worked with me
          (even if you didn't know it) and I would love to stay in touch.
          I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, so please <a href="//mehulkar.com/contact">get in touch</a>!
        </p>
